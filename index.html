        <p>Gascogne is a beautiful and magical realm where creatures of all shapes and sizes live next to one another.  Its rivers bring merchants from nearby kingdoms who trade their exotic wares for Gascognian crops and livestock.  For countless aeons life has continued so.  Though Gascogne is not always so easygoing: wicked monsters from the uncharted forests and wastelands have been known to terrorize peaceful villages, and Gascogne's relationship with its neighbors can at times teeter toward bloodshed.  Adventurers like yourselves play a key role in protecting the Asgarnian way of life, and every few generations even the smallest village will produce a true Hero.  Someone with a keen sense of justice and a strong will to protect those weaker than themselves.</p>
        <p>Eager would-be champions such as these will find themselves at home at the Academy of Tranquility; an esteemed place of higher education located in the remote Sabres valley.  Those who pass through the infamous Test Dungeon are invited to spend two years learning helpful skills such as weapon mastery, spellcasting, archery, and dragon hunting.  Of course, it won't always be easy.  The professors at the Academy of Tranquility can have some pretty high expectations, and every year many students lose their scholarships after losing an embarrassing fight to a mountain troll or accidentally turning a classmate into a newt.</p>
