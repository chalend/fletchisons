        <h1>Campus Life</h1>
        <p>Fletchisons campus is nestled in the bountiful Valley of the Pontar and the River of Knowledge flows right through the center of our quads.  Between classes, students are encouraged to join clubs which compete in a variety of diversions: from Capture the Flag to Public Debate.</p>
        <p>Some of Fletchisons esteemed clubs include "Aspiring Dungeonmasters," "Gnome Choir," and "Treehuggers United."  Upon enrolling, you'll have the chance to enlist in a club and rise through its ranks.  Clubs compete annually in the Grand Guild Games and earn points throughout the year for their members' accomplishments.</p>
        <p>Many students live in the nearby town of Aarkat.  It's an easy-going place where you can find groceries, entertainment, and mead off-campus.  Townies like Old Man Aruuka simply forgot to leave Aarkat after graduating, and still hand out various errands and quests to over-eager froshers.</p>
        <p>Ready to get out of the house, make friends, and find your calling in the bottom of a mead mug?  Apply today.</p>
