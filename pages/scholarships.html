        <h1>Scholarships</h1>
        <p>Fletchisons' many independently overseen scholarships allow even the dirtiest lowly peasant to sell themselves or their families into indentured servitude so that they might line the pockets of Fletchisons' esteemed professors.</p>
        <p>While applying, simply check the box if you require a scholarship to attend.  If it is decided that you shall be admitted, a scholarship offer will be attached to your acceptance letter.</p>
        <p>Though different every year due to the rapidly shifting landscape of sponsors, here is a smattering of past scholarships to get an idea of what you're getting into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prince Dubloon sponsored Yara the Wood Elf to study to become a Ranger.  Upon graduation, Yara slew the mighty dragon Nazarrah who had for many years terrorized Prince Dubloon's kingdom.  Or, should have, had Yara not perished in the attempt.</li>
            <li>After Spookaloo the Tiefling traded their family's souls for a degree in Paladin, they fell out of favor with their Good-leaning God and lost their recently earned status.</li>
            <li>Fitting for someone who studied the art of the Rogue, Samwell Tiding staged an arson to net his unnamed benefactor a tidy sum from insurance.</li>
            <li>After Lady Alabaster's lost her teeth to a methamphetamine addiction, she sponsored a student to chew her food for her thrice daily for the rest of her days.</li>
        </ul>
